# Bootstrap-Portfolio
I made my portfolio using Bootstrap.
First of all I created  new GitHub repositorie and name it `Bootstrap-Portfolio`.
Inside my `Bootstrap-Portfolio` repo, Icreated `index.html`, `portfolio.html`, `contact.html` and assets (were I have images).
I made navbar and responsive layout (with the grid, rows and columns).
When I was writing code I concidered that we have different sizes of screens now, and wrote code with appropriate layout.
I started with my images(from images file). Then desided to go with bootstrap managed images. Wonderful, different layout. I chose to do it like a bonus for portfolio page.(I saved my original images for more experiments with it).
I used footer with Bootstrap and changed Copyright to Made by Sveta and added social icons on side(stackoverflaw and gidhub have working links).
I used "hover" for "footer name" and "footer icons".
Added W3 validator icon on index file.
It was fun working on this project.
